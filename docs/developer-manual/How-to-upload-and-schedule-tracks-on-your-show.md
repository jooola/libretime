DJ tutorial series part 1

Intro:

This is a part of a series of tutorials for how to use the LibreTime radio station automation system. In this particular video we will explain how a user can upload tracks and schedule them for future playback by LibreTime.

As a DJ using LibreTime your primary responsibility is to populate the schedule for the shows you have been given permission to schedule for by your station administrator. You should be provided a login and password by your administrator and a web site address. Go to this website and login.

The LibreTime software is designed primarily to facilitate pre-scheduled shows. If you want to broadcast live during your timeslot then see the following video.

LibreTime works with a library of uploaded tracks. The supported types of tracks are mp3, aac, wav & ogg. If you don’t have any local copies of the music you want to play you will either need to digitize, download or stream your show live and playback the files. In addition you might have a compilation of your show as a single audio file such as an mp3 exported from Audacity. See the links in the description for videos describing how to use audacity.

For the purposes of this we will consider that you have a number of different mp3 music files that you want to add to your show located on your computer. As a DJ you can add to the tracks by clicking the blue Upload button in the top left section of the screen. This opens up a tab on the left where you can either drop files directly from the filesystem of your computer or audio program. You can also click on the window to open up a filesystem browse option for your computer. This window will vary depending upon your operating system but you should be able to find and select one or more audio files.

After this the software will start the uploading process. While this is happening you need to leave this window open. If you try to leave or close it a warning will pop up on the screen. Once this is done you should see the uploaded tracks listed on the right side of your browser. The system will now be processing your files and making sure that they will be playable by LibreTime. Once they are done the Import Status should show Successfully imported. If any of them fail to import you should see a message. You can also check for failed tracks by clicking the failed button. Usually tracks will be imported within a few minutes of uploading. If you notice they are stuck in pending for longer than that please contact your system administrator so they can check the status of the software.

Now that you have uploaded the tracks you want to air during your show you can go back to the Dashboard on the left menu item. If your show is coming up within the next few hours it will be displayed under Scheduled Shows and you should see the tracks your uploaded on the left sorted by the Uploaded column. If you don’t see Uploaded you can click Columns scroll down to Uploaded and check the box next to it. If you select any other Columns they will be displayed on the Track library. Now click Uploaded twice until the arrow to the right of Uploaded is pointing down. This will be sorting the tracks based upon the latest tracks to be uploaded.

If you want to limit the tracks being displayed to only tracks that you have uploaded with your DJ name you can click the arrow to the right of the search bar and this will open up the Advanced search criteria. Click the box next to Owner and type in your username and it should limit the library to displaying tracks that match your name. You can close this window by click back on the background.
By default LibreTime will show all upcoming shows limited to the next 3 hours. Unless you are also a Program Manager you won’t be able to add tracks to any shows except for the ones you have been given access to. The only show these shows you can click the small drop-down menu in the top that says Filter By Show and click My Shows.

This will display all of the upcoming shows that you have been given access to schedule. If you don’t see your show you can click the date to increase the date range of shows being displayed. Now click find shows and if you have any shows coming up within that time you should see the shows listed on the right. Now starts the fun part. You can drag tracks from the left and add them to the show playlist. You can also click and drag the tracks to rearrange their order. In addition you can also click the checkmark to the left of the tracks and click Add After selected items. This will add it to the first show listed that you have access to. So if you are also a Program Manager be careful or else you could add tracks to other shows.

The amount of unscheduled time remaining in the show will be displayed on the bottom of the show. As you add more tracks this number should decrease. If you add a track that goes over the show time it will be highlighted in orange. This means that this track will be cut off when LibreTime transitions to the next show. Any tracks listed in red won’t be played at all. To get rid of these tracks you can click the red Trim overbooked shows button

You can also remove tracks by clicking the checkbox next to them and clicking the Red Remove button. Your station will have an ideal time they want you to aim for on the schedule as there might be intro and outro playlists used to add station specific tracks such as station IDs and promos into your show playlist shortly before it airs. Please contact your station manager or admin to find out what they desire.

Once you are done scheduling you can sit back and enjoy your show. If you want to preview how it sounds you can click the grey speaker icon next to a track. This should open up a Audio Player pop-up on your browser and start playing the tracks. Currently this player doesn’t playback flac files although they will still be played by the LibreTime broadcast. The developers are aware of this bug. 

Another way you can find your show and review the tracks or upload new ones is via the Calendar menu. This will be default display the month view of shows and you can find the day your upcoming show airs and click the background of it and a menu should pop-up and you can click Schedule Tracks and this will open up a scheduling window that just contains this specific show. You can add or remove tracks as you would via the Dashboard but it will only be the specific show you chose to schedule. 

To see the tracks on past shows that aired you can click on the show and click View. This will display a track list that you won’t be able to preview or edit.

And that is the end of this tutorial on how to schedule tracks for your show using LibreTime. If you have any questions you can comment below or post on the LibreTime discourse forum (link also in the description below).

In the next tutorial I will explain the basics of broadcasting live during your show.
