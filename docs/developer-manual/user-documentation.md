The LibreTime documentation site is generated with [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). To get started contributing to this project, fork it on Github. Then install mkdocs and clone this repo locally:

```bash
sudo brew install python              # For OSX users
sudo aptitude install python-pip      # For Debian/Ubuntu users
sudo pip install mkdocs
git clone https://github.com/libretime/libretime
cd libretime
git remote add sandbox https://github.com/<username>/libretime   # URL for your fork
mkdocs build --clean
mkdocs serve
```

Your local LibreTime docs site should now be available for browsing: <http://localhost:8888/>.

When you find a typo, an error, unclear or missing explanations or instructions, open a new terminal and start editing. Your changes should be reflected automatically on the local server. Find the page you’d like to edit; everything is in the docs/ directory. Make your changes, commit and push them, and start a pull request:

```bash
git checkout -b fix_typo
vim docs/index.md                      # Add/edit/remove whatever you see fit. Be bold!
mkdocs build --clean; mkdocs serve    # Go check your changes. We’ll wait...
git diff                              # Make sure there aren’t any unintended changes.
git commit -am”Fixed typo.”           # Useful commit message are a good habit.
git push sandbox fix_typo
```

Visit your fork on Github and start a PR.
