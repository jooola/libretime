Each feature that is implemented in LibreTime must be documented in the [manual](https://libretime.org/docs). This helps our users and reduces the complexity for people getting started with the project. Feature documentation should be linked to from within LibreTime's web interface where appropriate. The documentation must follow the following guidelines:

- For pages that document specific “sections” or pages of LibreTime, there should be a help button included that links to page in the manual.
- The manual should include a write-up description of each option in the same order that it is presented in the UI.
- All sections should have a basic description of the functionality and, if they are advanced, a link to a more detailed page where the design justification and explanation is made.
- Complex features should link to a tutorial in the tutorial section for how to use them. This link should be from the feature's documentation page.
- All current bugs/issues that are relevant to the feature/section should have links embedded in the documentation. The issues should then be labelled as `manual-documented`, which is removed when the issue is resolved and the reference removed from the documentation.
