## Script

Building a basic schedule with LibreTime tutorial
Intro: In this tutorial we will show you how to create a broadcast schedule for your station with different shows airing at different times during the week. This is intended for people who are Program Managers for their LibreTime instance as they will have the appropriate permissions to do the tasks assigned on this.

First thing you can click the Calendar on the left hand of the screen. This will default to a month view. If you are looking at an empty Calendar then it is now your job to populate it with different shows. If you are a FCC licensed station or are otherwise required to do top of the hour station IDs the easiest way to accomplish this is to break up all of your shows into one hour. If you are doing a net based station you can break them into whatever logical segments you want based upon time of the day.

NEED TO CHANGE THE SPECIFICS HERE TO MATCH THE RECORDING

For the purposes of this tutorial we will create a new show that runs every weekday at 8am.
So click the blue New Show – Icon – and a menu will pop up on the left.
For the purposes of this the import sections are opened by default. You should type in a Name for this we will use Morning News Hour – you don’t need to fill in URL, Genre or Description but you can if it would be helpful. Next you should go to the When section. And click “In the Future vs the Now radio”.

Then select the next Monday – click 08 under the hour and 00 for the Minute
This show will be an hour long so we will click 09 00 for the end time.
Now we want this show to repeat every week day (excluding weekends so we click the repeats button)

So we check the boxes next to Monday through Friday and then click Add this Show.

By Default No End is this checked and this means that you intend your show to air indefinitely. You can uncheck this and select an End Date but it isn’t necessary. If and when you decide to change your show you can just delete future instances and then create a new show to replace it.

And so now we just need to repeat this until your schedule is full for 24 hours of the day.

So for the next segment of this tutorial we are going to show you how to assign a DJ to a certain show.
By default only Admins can create Users, so if you aren’t also an Admin you will need to reach out to your Admin to perform this next step.

“Creating User ID”
Click Settings and then Users and then New User
The important parts here are Username – the password fields e-mail and UserType – everything else is optional.

Type in some information in the field and choose DJ for the usertype and then Save.

Now we will go back to the Calendar and create a show for this DJ.

SuperDJ will be broadcasting everyday from 9am to 11am following the morning news show. So we select the appropriate times under When and now we go to Who and check the box next to superDJ if there are a lot of DJs in the list you can also type the name and it will autocomplete and you can click the name and it will add a check next to their name.

Now we click Save this show. And the superdj user will be able to login and upload and schedule tracks for their show. Notice we did a 2 hour block so the automation software won’t be able to automatically schedule a station ID at the top of the second hour so if you need to do this it’ll be the responsibility of the DJ to make sure they say whatever legal ID is required.

And that is how you can create a show that can be scheduled by a DJ at your station.

You might be thinking wow, this is a lot of work, how are we possibly going to schedule 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This is where the automation side of things comes in, in the next tutorial I’ll show you how to use a feature we call AutoLoading playlists along with Podcasts and Smartblocks to automate the scheduling of tracks in your calendar to make running your station a lot easier.
