This is an attempt to create a list of all assets and info on the LibreTime manual at libretime.org that need to be updated as they refer to an old version of 2.5.1 or we have changed the features etc.

Pages in dire need of update:

- [Users](http://libretime.org/manual/users/) - needs updated screenshots
- [Stream Settings](http://libretime.org/manual/stream-settings/) - at least need to update and remove Scheduled Play as we don't have that feature
- [Calendar](http://libretime.org/manual/calendar/) - UPDATED - could use a little bit more info on automatic playlists
- [Listen](http://libretime.org/manual/listen/) - probably ok but could use new screenshots
- [Recording](http://libretime.org/manual/recording-shows/) - currently not supported by LibreTime - needs info regarding this
- ~[Features](http://libretime.org/features/) - is all TBD~
- ~[On The Air in 60 seconds](http://libretime.org/manual/on-air-in-60-seconds/) - needs instructions refined for LibreTime~ (DONE)
- ~[Getting Started](http://libretime.org/manual/getting-started/) - remove info about Registering since we don't do that - and need to update Image assets w/ new screenshots~ (DONE)
- ~[Settings General](http://libretime.org/manual/preferences/) - refers to settings that don't exist like Soundcloud and e-mail settings~ (DONE)
- ~[Media Folders](http://libretime.org/manual/media-folders/) - this functionality doesn't exist in LibreTime should be at least updated w/ a notice and link to PR~
- ~[Support/Feedback](http://libretime.org/manual/support-feedback/) - put info about Fork and links to Github and discourse forum vs. referring to SourceFabric~ (Removed in favour of [Help](http://libretime.org/manual/help/))
- ~[Dashboard](http://libretime.org/manual/dashboard/) - needs new screenshots~
- ~[Upload](http://libretime.org/manual/upload/) - needs new screenshots for new UI~
- ~[Library](http://libretime.org/manual/library/) - needs info on Auto Playlists and smartblock updates(maybe should be easier for find Smart Blocks and Web Streams from main menu vs. hidden under Library)~
- ~[Help](http://libretime.org/manual/help/) - needs links to LibreTime~ (DONE)
- ~[Install](http://libretime.org/install/) - should refer to ./install -fiap for most purposes~
- ~[Preparing Server](http://libretime.org/manual/preparing-the-server/) - need to remove reference to system / and debian squeeze as we don't support that. Possibly add info regarding distro etc.~
