  How to upload a promo

Intro:
This LibreTime tutorial is oriented to DJ users of a already setup Libretime system.

In this tutorial we will explain how you can upload a short promotional segment that will be scheduled automatically between shows and in between music tracks on automatically generated playlists.

To do this you will first need to record a short audio segment and encode it as a an audio file such as a mp3. Once you have this recorded and edited to the appropriate length you can then open up your LibreTime instance and login.

For the purposes of this tutorial we are going to assume that you didn’t add the appropriate metadata to categorize your track when you were exporting it but for future reference you can usually do this with Audactity or whatever program you exported your audio track from.

So now that the track has been uploaded we are going to make sure that it matches the criteria for a promo smartblock. The promo smartblock should be setup already by a program manager and inserted into the schedule. As a DJ you won’t be able to edit smartblocks created by anyone else but we can duplicate the smartblock and view the criteria that way.

Now you can click edit and see what the smartblock contains. Basically it looks for tracks that have the Genre metadata tag set equal to promo and it selects one of them. If you click preview it will pull a random track from the database.

Now we are going to show you how to make sure the track you just uploaded will match for this. Click on tracks and click Uploaded and it should show the latest tracks that were uploaded. This should include your new track. Click on the track and click edit. Now you can go to Genre and type in promo and save it. Now if you click preview a few times you should see your track show up (unless there are a lot of promos already).

Everything is all setup. Now if you are working on your stations live system you should go and delete the smartblock you created so that you aren’t cluttering up the station list of smartblocks.
